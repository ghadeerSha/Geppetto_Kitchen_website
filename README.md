# Geppetto_Kitchen_website

Code for the project can be found under file Final.


- My partner and I have collaborated to create a website for an Italian restaurant, where we've developed custom menus and designed our own logo. Specializing in pizza, pasta, desserts, and more.

- Upon selecting from our menu bar options - Brunch, Pizza, Pasta, Desserts, or Beverages - users are seamlessly directed to their chosen category.

- Users can explore the "Gallery" to view a diverse array of foods offered by the restaurant. Additionally, by clicking on a specific photo, it will enlarge for a better view.
